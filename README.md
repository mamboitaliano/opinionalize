# SurveyChimp

A mini version of SurveyMonkey. Used Rails stack, with ActiveRecord and PostgerSQL for the database, and a Javascript-JQuery frontend with Bootstrap and Spritely.js. A user can sign up, sign in or sign in using Google OAuth 2.0 and the omniauth-google-oauth2 gem. A user can create, edit, receive responses to and delete surveys. 

I plan to fix bugs, add functionality such as survey sharing via email, and deploy it to Heroku by November.
